      <h2>Hello world</h2>

      <p>I'm starting a blog today, because I would like to record my progress on learning programming, and I also want to set and register my current plans.
        To tell you more about my background, I'm a junior student of software engineering, which I've been studying on the last 2 years.
        I have a past experience in working with engineering and urbanism, because I have a prior degree in environmental engineering.
        I live in Brazil currently, where I am from. I also could live in the U.S. for 2 years long, when I was doing exchange undergrad.</p>

        <p>My recent studies of coding have been focuded on learning C and C++, and I am taking side studies of HTML and CSS.
        In order to set a plan, I've joined to the 100 Days of Code challenge of the FreeCodeCamp, and about a week ago, I've finished the basic web development steep.
        I'm thinking about in gather my efforts on learning JavaScript from now ahead.</p>

        <p>I will share here some links of blogs and stuffs I've been reading and speeding some time studying.
        I hope I can write more efficiently on my next posts, and I hope someone are able to understand me here.</p>
