        <h1><strong>Marcia Rodrigues</strong></h1>

        <p>I am an environmental engineer aspiring as a software developer.<br>
          I currently live in Brazil, in the city of Londrina, where I work, volunteer, hang out and study programming.

        <p>My interests range from technology and programming to entrepreneurship and sustainability.
          I’m also interested in lifelong learning, travelling, and coffee.</p>

        <p>After attending some technology-related meetups and gathering together in a project that teaches programming and robotics,
        I've developed deep interest in learning and improving software development skills.</p>

        <p>In a previous period, by working with engineering and urban planning, my interest was triggered when applying smart city concepts
         in the city planning.</p>

        <p>As I believe coding skills cross several knowledge areas, my purpose is to acquire knowledge and expertise in software development
          and to apply them in everyday life.</p>
