        <p><em><h2>Xxxxxxxx</h2></em></p>

        <p>I'm a graduate Environmental Engineer, currently studying software development at SENAI's Software Engineering programme.</p>

        <p>Recently, I had worked with urban planning, specifically elaborating urban management and public service proposals with Smart City concepts in mind.<br>
          After attendeding several technology-related meetups and events, I've decided to learn about software development.<br>
          My purpose is to acquire knowledge in new tools and have programming skills at my disposal, as I believe this is a necessity in current times.<br>
          I've developed an interest in web technologies, which is why i'm currently improving my abilities in HTML, CSS and Git.</p>

         <p>My most recent project participations were "Startup Weekend", "The Odin Project", "English Social Group of Londrina"<br>
            and collaboration with the "Techninas/UEL" volunteer project, which teaches programming and robotics to children and young people.</p>
